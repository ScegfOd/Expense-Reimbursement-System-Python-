# Project 1: Expense Reimbursement System (Python)

# Summary
A reiumbursment website that isn't quite fully DnD themed yet, but some of the mock data mentions goblins stealing things. Employees can make reimbursment requests and review request status for their own requests. Managers can make requests, review any request status, accept any other employee's request, reject their own request, try to approve their own requests to recieve castigation, leave (or omit) reasons for the decision, and see statistics on all company requests currently in the database.
